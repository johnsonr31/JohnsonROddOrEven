# RJohnsonOddOrEven

This program will allow the user to input a whole number. This will be saved as a string and converted to an int, and will then be processed to figure out if it is odd or even.
Whether or not it is odd or even will be printed to the console, along with the number itself. The user will also be able to choose whether or not they want to play again.

Peer Review: Brandon Le - Program works properly and I had no issues at all. Data validation worked all around until I entered a proper input. I liked how in the beginning it gave you the option right away to choose to play or not play. And the thing I liked the most was the annotations in the code. I haven't been seeing people do that. I really liked how he explained everything and it made it easy to follow along especially if you were someone that was just learning this stuff brand new. Nice project. Very good job!
